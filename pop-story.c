You make your way to the town\nsquare and fill your flask with water which flows from\nthe spout of a fountain carved in the shape of a dragon's\nhead. After quenching your thirst, you search through a\npile of rubbish and find some squashed tomatoes and a\nchunk of bread left to rot in a wooden crate. The bread\nis stale but right now a tomato sandwich seems like the\nbreakfast of champions.\n\nThe sandwich takes the edge off your hunger but you know\nyou could eat more.

An hour\nlater the sea starts to get choppy as dark clouds gather\noverhead. A few drops of rain begin to fall, and the\nwaves build as the wind increases. It is not long enough before\nthe Blue Marlin is being battered by a howling gale with\nwaves crashing over the deck. Rain lashes down, and\nyou have to hang on to the rigging for your life as the\nboat is tossed about on the churning sea.

Looking at Hog Houes fills you with a sense\nof foreboding. Its dark stone walls and narrow windows\nare anything but welcoming.
