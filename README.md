<h1>Port Of Peril</h1>

<p>This collection of code was my first personal project I ever created using C after reading the Head First C book by O'Reilly. It is a text adventure that has a rudimentary combat system, both of which are drawn from the Fighting Fantasy series written by Ian Livingstone, that is run and played in the terminal. It was meant to be a practical exercise to see if I could utilize the concepts I had learned and practiced while reading the book for concepts such as pointers, and reading and accessing data.</p>
